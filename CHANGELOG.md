# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Outcome (prediction) market support: `OutcomeMeta`, `OutcomeInfo`, `OutcomeQuestion`, `OutcomeSideSpec` types
- `HttpClient::outcome_meta()` and standalone `hypercore::outcome_meta()` for querying HIP-4 markets
- HyperCore WS subscriptions for `userEvents`, `userTwapSliceFills`, `userTwapHistory`, `activeAssetData`, and `webData2`
- New typed WS payloads for user events, TWAP slice/history streams, and active asset data
- Forward-compatible fallback parsing for unknown `userEvents` payload variants
- New example: `examples/hypercore/websocket-user-events.rs`

### Changed

- Extended WebSocket docs/snippets in README and crate docs to include advanced user streams
- Added serde test coverage for the new WS channels and payload schemas

## [v0.1.5] - 2026-01-12

### Added

- Added `Cancel` variant to `OkResponse` enum for order cancellation responses
- Added test case for cancel response deserialization
- Added credentials example showing common argument patterns across examples
- Made signing module public (`pub mod signing`)

### Changed

- **Breaking**: Morpho APY calculations now use generic types for high precision arithmetic
  - `PoolApy` and `VaultApy` are now generic over `T128` type parameter
  - `apy()` methods require conversion functions to handle custom numeric types (f64, Decimal, etc.)
  - Enables arbitrary precision calculations for financial computations
- Refactored examples to use common credential and argument handling patterns
- Updated morpho examples to use new generic APY API with explicit conversions

### Fixed

- Fixed API type structs for cancellation and modification responses

### Dependencies

- hypecli v0.1.3: Updated dependencies including alloy and hypersdk versions

**Files Changed**: 24 files, +556 insertions, -249 deletions

## [v0.1.4] - 2026-01-10

### Added

- Created new `types/api.rs` module with core API request/response types (788 lines)
- Added `types/solidity.rs` module for Solidity type conversions
- Added signature recovery functionality to `Action` enum (`recover()` method)
- Added `prehash()` method to `Action` for obtaining signing hashes without signing
- Added methods to `HttpClient`: `multi_sig_config()`, `api_agents()`

### Changed

- **Breaking**: Removed `Signable` trait in favor of methods directly on `Action` enum
  - Actions now implement `sign()`, `sign_sync()`, `prehash()`, and `recover()` directly
  - Simplified signing API with unified interface through `Action` enum
- **Breaking**: Split `types.rs` into modular structure: `types/mod.rs`, `types/api.rs`, `types/solidity.rs`
- Reorganized HTTP client to use new type organization
- Refactored signing module, reducing from 700+ lines to ~26 lines by moving logic to `Action`
- hypecli: Switched to simple P2P connections instead of gossip protocol in iroh integration
- hypecli: Enhanced multisig handling with improved error handling and flow

### Documentation

- Added comprehensive module-level documentation for `types/api.rs`
- Improved signing module documentation explaining new architecture
- Updated README with 33 lines of new content

### Dependencies

- hypecli: Upgraded to hypersdk 0.1.3
- hypecli: Force rustls for TLS (added `reqwest-rustls-tls` feature)
- hypecli: Updated dependency versions in Cargo.lock (344 fewer lines after optimization)

**Files Changed**: 14 files, +1477 insertions, -2072 deletions
